## 🛡️ Security First
Security is not an optional feature — it's a culture in my development workflow.  
I always design systems with strong security principles in mind:

- Secure Authentication (JWT Rotation, Refresh Tokens)
- Protection against **XSS, SQL Injection, CSRF, Brute Force**
- Strong input validation (Backend & Frontend)
- Secure password hashing (Argon2 / bcrypt)
- API Gateway protection & rate limiting
- Principle of Least Privilege for all services
- Safe handling of secrets & configuration management
- Clean Architecture with strict boundaries
